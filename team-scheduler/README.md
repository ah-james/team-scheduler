# Team Scheduler

Team Scheduler is a CRUD application designed to help you maintain a database of your employees, their job titles, and what days they've been scheduled to work.

## Installation

- This application is run using React
- Fork and Clone this repository with ```git clone```
- Run the following commands in order in your terminal to start the backend server

```cd backend```
```rails s```

- Open up a new terminal (keep your current one running!) and run the frontend with the following commands

```cd frontend```
```npm install```

## Usage

In your terminal that's currently in the frontend folder, input ```npm start``` in your terminal to create a local server. Once running, the command will open a new page in your default web browser under:

```http://localhost:3001```

After the webpage has loaded, use the navbar in the top right corner to navigate to different pages.

Begin by using the "Titles" tab to create a new title for your staff along with a description of the title to create job options for your employees.

After your titles have been created, head to the "Employees" tab to create your staff, using their name along with how long they've worked for you, along with an image (if you wish) and tie them to one of the job titles that you just created.

Finally, head to the home page to view a chart of days of the week and dropdown menus for each title, input your desired employee into each position.
